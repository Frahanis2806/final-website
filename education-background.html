	<p align="justify">"This is my primary school memory that will never fade.
    I was admitted to the hospital with food poisoning a week before the UPSR. I was too sick and felt too ill to study 
	for the UPSR next week while I was in the ward. I had blood drawn practically daily while I was in the ward to check 
	for bacterial infections in my internal organs. The doctor therefore verified that my increased blood pressure was 
	caused by stress. The doctor made the decision not to take any more blood because the UPSR was getting close. 
	My bacterial infection worsened as a result, forcing me to go through the UPSR in a hospital. The UPSR experience
	in the hospital, where exam papers were delivered by a single white van, was equally fascinating. Plus, the exam
	paper was concealed preserved in multiple files. To conclude my story,
    I encountered a few difficulties answering the exam because I wasn't well-prepared and didn't study. 
	But my UPSR results were not that bad. I still proud of myself. Click here to know more."</p><p><a href="https://ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekolah_Kebangsaan_Lukut"><i>Primary School</i></a></p></th>
